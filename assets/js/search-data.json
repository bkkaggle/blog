            "content": ". Part 1: Best Practices for Finetuning Large Transformer Language models . Part 2: How I (almost) replicated OpenAI’s GPT-2 (124M version) . . TL;DR . . A few months ago I started working on a research project trying to pretrain my own, more efficient language model from scratch. I got access to a 128-core TPUv3 pod from the Tensorflow Reseach Cloud and used it to pretrain a $124$M parameter GPT-2 model to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI’s results (my pretrained model was trained for about $1/8$th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got $21$ ppl on OpenWebText compared to $17$ ppl for OpenAI’s model), and then pretrained an ALBERT-style GPT-2 (that I’m calling ALGPT2) language model with a factorized input embedding and layer-wise parameter sharing that would reduce the number of paramters in the model from $124$M to around $12$M. . Unfortunately, ALGPT-2 doesn’t perform as well as GPT-2 (ALGPT-2 gets $31$ ppl on OpenWebText compared to $21$ ppl for my pretrained GPT-2 model), but I’m writing this series of blog posts to go through everything I’ve learned over the last few months. . . The Idea . . The main thing that I wanted to do from this sort-of “research project” that I was working on by myself this spring was to develop and train a more efficient version of the $124$M parameter version of GPT-2. I wanted to pretrain the $1.5$B parameter version of GPT-2 but since I only got access to the TPU pod for a week, I had to choose a model that would train in time. A $100$k iteration training run takes about $20$ hours to run which gave me plenty of time to run multiple experiments. In contrast, following OpenAI’s training procedure exactly and training for the full $800$k iterations would take up almost an entire week and use up most of my quota. . I was able to almost replicate the $124$M parameter version of GPT-2 by pretraining it to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI’s results (my pretrained model used was trained for about $1/8$th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got $21$ perplexity (ppl) on the standard OpenWebText dataset compared to $17$ ppl for OpenAI’s model), . My idea of making a more efficient transformer didn’t really work out since my pretrained transformer ended up being about $20$ppl worse than an equivalent GPT-2 model, but I wanted to writeup what I learned over the two or three months that I was working on this anyway. . . Background . . A little bit about myself: I’m an incoming software engineering student at the University of Waterloo and this post is supposed to be a writeup of a NLP research project that I was working on from around March to May of 2020 (right in the middle of the first Covid-19 lockdown of 2020, I’m currently writing this on July 15, 2020 while waiting for my Pix2PixHD model to train for a few hundred epochs on colab for a new project that I’m working on). . Over the last three or four years I’ve done a lot of machine learning related stuff. I started out back in early 2017 by going through the Introduction to Machine Learning with Python and Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow books. At the time, I didn’t really understand all the math behind neural networks, but it got me hooked on ML and then I took the deeplearning.ai courses on Coursera and the original fast.ai course (back in late 2017 when they hadn’t switched over to Pytorch and still used Tensorflow and Keras). . I started competing on Kaggle in early 2018 and kept on competing in competitions non-stop for about a year and a half, winning a few medals and becoming a competitions expert (At one point I was ranked in the top $100$ Kagglers on the competitions leaderboard). Kaggle was a really nice way to get a lot of experience using neural networks because of the wide range of competitions and datasets that I had access to. I started out by doing a few semantic segmentation competitions then moved onto competing in NLP competitions. Since around mid 2019, I’ve been working on a bunch of different projects in ML and lower-level CS stuff. I worked on making a PyTorch-style machine learning library in C++ and more recently in Rust, and for the last few months I’ve also been trying to keep up with all the new machine learning (esp. NLP) papers on arXiv. . I was pretty lucky that I started learning NLP right before transformers exploded in popularity, I remember when word2vec and LSTMs were still SOTA on a lot of NLP tasks, and it has been really interesting to see how much the field of NLP has changed in just a few years, going from when LSTMs with only a a handful of layers and somewhere on the order of $512$ units were considered to be large networks and computationally expensive to train, to training LSTMs with attention layers on top, to the original transformer encoder/decoder networks, to ULMFIT and ELMO, then BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and T5, to just a few months ago with the explosion of new, more efficient replacements for self-attention like the Sparse Transformer, the Reformer, and Synthesizers, and now GPT-3, which IMO has the potential to really change the whole field of NLP. . Just a few years ago we trained shallow recurrent networks on datasets, then pretrained large transformer language models on large datasets and finetuned on task-specific datasets. Now the whole idea of just training a gigantic language model on a huge dataset, then conditioning the model in a form of few-shot learning by prepending a few examples of a certain task to an input feels like it can really make NLP models a lot more accessible and easier to productionize as well as making human-chatbot interactions a lot more realistic than they are today. . I’ve rambled on for long enough, lets get to the main topic of this post. . . GPT-2 and ALBERT . . GPT-2 is a transformer decoder. . The embedding layer at the root of the model maps a one-hot vector of a given token’s index (all the GPT-2 models use a vocabulary size of $50257$) to a $768$ dimensional vector (all GPT-2 numbers in this blog post will be for the $124$m parameter version of GPT-2). . The embedding matrix is followed by a stack of self-attention and feed-forward layers that each output a $768$ dimensional vector (keeping the number of outputs for each layer constant), which makes up the main part of the transformer. . The stack of self-attention layers is then followed by an output embedding (the weights of the input and output embeddings are tied to make training easier) that maps the $768$ dimensional vector that is the output of the last layer of the transformer to the same $50257$ dimensional vector that represents the probability of each token in the vocabulary being the next token in the sequence. . Take a look at The Illustrated GPT-2 for a more in-depth look into GPT-2. . ALBERT (A Lite BERT) is a paper that takes a look at BERT and identifies some ways in which to make it more efficient and reduce the number of parameters in the model in four major ways: a factorized embedding, layer-wise parameter sharing, a sentence-order-prediction auxillary loss, and removing dropout. . . Factorized embedding . . GPT-2’s embedding has a lot of parameters. It’s really just a matrix of dimensions $50257 times 768$. That means that the input embedding alone uses up almost $50257 times 768 = space sim 38,000,000$ parameters which is a pretty big chunk of the $128$M total parameters in the model. . The ALBERT authors propose a factorized embedding with an intermediate embedding size of $128$: one embedding of size $50257 times 128$ and another embedding of size $128 times 768$. By breaking up the large embedding matrix into two smaller matrices, the total number of parameters used in the embedding goes from about $38$M to about $6$M. . $50257 times 128 = sim 6,000,000$ . $128 times 768 = sim 100,000$ . The authors try different intermediate embedding sizes and settle on $128$ as a good tradeoff betweeen parameters and performance. . . Layer-wise parameter sharing . . In a normal transformer model, the transformer layers are created something like this: . class BERT(nn.Module): def __init__(self, n_layers): super().__init__() // ... self.blocks = nn.ModuleList([Block() for _ in range(n_layers)]) // ... def forward(self, x): // ... for block in self.blocks: x = block(x) // ... . ALBERT shares all parameters across the transformer layers something like this: . class ALBERT(nn.Module): def __init__(self, n_layers): super().__init__() // ... self.n_layers = n_layers self.block = Block() // ... def forward(self, x): // ... for _ in self.n_layers: x = block(x) // ... . By only defining one transformer block and looping around it n_layers times, ALBERT saves the GPU memory that would be used to store the parameters for all the layers. . Since we normally use $32$ bit floats to store parameters on the GPU, storing the $1.5$B parameter GPT-2 on the GPU will use up about $6$GB of the GPU’s memory — that’s a pretty big chunk of the $16$GB of memory that’s on a normal V100 GPU already being used up before taking into account the memory needed to store the model’s activations as well as any momentum parameters needed by the optimizer. In contrast, if you share parameters across all transformer layers in the $1.5$B parameter GPT-2, the resulting model will only have about $37$M parameters, the parameter-sharing version would only use up around $148$MB of GPU memory. . The authors try applying parameter sharing to BERT and see that it reduces performance but makes it easier to train larger and larger models. . In a machine learning framework like JAX, which by default unrolls and inlines loops when it’s compiling your code with XLA, the size of the unrolled and inlined loop would make the computation graph really large and take a long time to compile. This is why you’re recommended to use somehting like lax.scan() in these situations. . . Sentence-order-prediction auxillary loss . The ALBERT authors add an auxillary loss to help training. Since language modelling is usually done autoregressively, I didn’t use this for my custom model. . . Removing dropout . The ALBERT authors remove all dropout from BERT and see that it significantly improves performance. . . That’s pretty much what my idea was: Take GPT-2, add a factorized embedding, share parameters across all transformer layers, remove dropout (I actually missed the part about ALBERT removing dropout until I was pretty far into my work, but I did run one or two runs without dropout to see how that works), and pretrain on a large dataset for a few hundred thousand iterations. . There’s no way that I could pretrain something like GPT-2 by myself, so I applied to the Tensorflow Research Cloud (TFRC). . The TFRC puts an emphasis on wanting to help researchers from non-traditional backgrounds which makes it an amazing resource for anyone who isn’t a “traditional” machine learning researcher. They were willing to give me, a 17 year old with no formal education or credentials (not even a high school diploma :/), access to an extremely powerful cluster of TPUs at no cost. Being able to be a part of this program was really helpful to me, especially since I don’t have access to a dedicated GPU and usually rely on Colab’s free GPU to train my models. . I emailed the TFRC team to ask if I could get upgraded from $5$ separate individual TPUv3’s (with 8 cores each) to a TPU pod to pretrain a large language model. The very next day (!) I got an email back saying that I could get access to a preemptible 128-core TPUv3 Pod for 7 days which unfortunately wasn’t long enough for me to pretrain the $1.5$B parameter model but was enough to train a few runs on the $124$M model. . . Setup . . So for setup I’ll be going through all the steps that I took to setup my VM and TPU Pod and preprocess the dataset as well. . When I was working on this project, I set up two VMs; One with a lot of RAM and CPU cores to process the data quickly and another small instance to run the TPU training script. One of the nice things about training on TPUs and TPU pods is that as long as your data has been preprocessed as a set of TFRecord files, you don’t need a really powerful VM instance which saves you a lot of money/compute credits. . You can look at this for a full list of every command that I used to setup the VM and preprocess the dataset. . . OpenWebText . . I used a n-1-standard-16 instance with TF2.1 to process the OpenWebText dataset. Make sure that you use an instance with a SSD instead of the default HDD because processing the dataset involves processing a lot of very small text files and is mostly limited by your drive’s io speed. I made the mistake of using a HDD and just extracting the dataset’s TAR archives took about 7 hours. I put all the data in a folder at ~/data/openwebtext/ so modify it if you want to download the data elsewhere. . TIL: most common linux utilities (like ls, mv, and cat) aren’t really that optimized for working with almost 10 million files like in OpenWebText. Just counting the number of text files in the dataset could take several minutes._ . Download the OpenWebText dataset (which is really just a tar archive of a bunch of tar archives that contain a lot of text files) and extract it: . gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EA5V0oetDCOke7afsktL_JDQ-ETtNOvx tar -xf openwebtext.tar.xz cat *.xz | tar -J -xf - -i . The dataset is about 12GB compressed and 53GB uncompressed and has just about 8 million text files. . I moved the first $100,000$ files in the dataset to a separate directory to create a validation set: . ls -f | head -100000 | xargs -i mv {} ../openwebtext-valid/ . . Tokenization . . I trained a Byte-level BPE tokenizer with a vocabulary size of $50,257$ (The same as GPT-2) on a $1$M file subset of the training set (I’m not sure if GPT-2 trains the tokenizer on the entire dataset or on just a subset, but I know that the CTRL paper trains their tokenizer on a 5% split of their training set.). I used Hugginface’s fast Rust-based Tokenizers library and their ByteLevelBPETokenizer tokenizer. . You can use my script here and run . python3 train_tokenizer.py --train_path ./data/openwebtext/ --save_path ./tokenizer/ --vocab_size 50257 --n_files 1000000 . to train the tokenizer, or just take a look at this for the main details (It just trains a tokenizer and saves it as well as a configuration file to disk): . import os import glob import json from tokenizers import ByteLevelBPETokenizer paths = glob.glob(os.path.join(&#39;./data/openwebtext&#39;, &#39;*&#39;))[:1000000] tok = ByteLevelBPETokenizer() tok.train(files=paths, vocab_size=args.vocab_size, special_tokens=args.control_codes) tok.save(&#39;./tokenizer/&#39;) tokenizer_config = { &quot;max_len&quot;: 1024 } with open(os.path.join(&#39;./tokenizer/&#39;, &quot;tokenizer_config.json&quot;), &#39;w&#39;) as fp: json.dump(tokenizer_config, fp) . . TFRecords . . TPU Pods expect your data to be available as a set of TFRecord files in a GCP cloud bucket that get downloaded to each of your TPU board’s built in powerful VM that will take care of de-serializing the files and feeding it to the TPU chips. Make sure that your GCP bucket and your TPU pod are in the same compute zone, otherwise you’ll quickly rack up a lot of charges by transferring hundreds of GBs of data across compute zones. . Here’s a thing that’s not very well documented when working with TPU Pods (this doesn’t really apply to TPUs as much): TPU Pods create a lot (100s of GBs) of logs that get sent to Stackdriver, where you get charged about 50 cents for each GiB of logs ingested beyond a certain limit (I think it’s around 50GiB/month). In just a few days of training, I ended up being charged about a $$100$ IIRC. Luckily, I still had most of the free GCP credits so this didn’t end up being a major problem for me, but make sure to turn off ingesting logs for TPUs. . I ran into a problem early on when I got access to the TPU pod where my code would work perfectly on a single TPU, but would throw an Out of range: End of sequence error when running it on a TPU pod. I struggled with this for a pretty long time until I took a look at this Kaggle discussion post that says that TPUs expect each TPU board (8 cores) to get its own TFrecord file (until that point, I was splitting the train set into 8 TFRecord files where I should’ve been splitting it into 16 (128 cores / 8 cores per board) TFRecord files. . TPUs are awesome for scaling to huge models and huge datasets, but there are a lot of TPU-specific information (especially for TPU Pods) that you need to know that’s not covered in the documentation and isn’t easy to find._** . You can use my script here and run . python3 make_tfrecords.py --path ./data/openwebtext/ --save_path ./train/ --files_per_tfrecord 500000 --use_control_codes --seq_len 1024 --min_seq_len --tokenizer ./tokenizer/ . python3 make_tfrecords.py --path ./data/openwebtext-valid/ --save_path ./val/ --files_per_tfrecord 50000 --use_control_codes --seq_len 1024 --min_seq_len --tokenizer ./tokenizer/ . to convert the raw text files from the train and validation splits into two sets of $16$ TFRecord files. . I ran a quick analysis on the average lengths of text fields in the dataset, $67$% of files have less than $1024$ tokens, $35$% of files have less than $512$ tokens, and only $10$% of files have less than $256$ tokens. This means that if I wanted to make the dataset as clean as possible and have each input sequence to the model be of a single contigous stream of $1024$ tokens, the dataset’s size would be a lot smaller. For this reason, everyone prepends a token like &lt;|endoftext|&gt; to the beginning of each sequence and concatenates together sequences with lengths smaller than $1024$. The specifics of how exactly you do that (e.g. do you treat the dataset as single stream of tokens and just break it up into sequences of length $1024$, or do you keep track of sequences smaller that $1024$ and just concatenate them together into a single sequence) really shouldn’t make too big of a difference in your model’s performance, but you can take a look at my implementation here. . My version doesn’t take full advantage of the fast, multithreaded batch_encode_plus() way to tokenize large datasets in parallel since it only keeps the first context_len tokens in each line of the files which makes dealing with files with more or less than $1024$ tokens harder. Because of this, tokenizing the dataset takes about $8$ hours, which is something I want to improve. . The train set comes out to about $26$GB and consists of about $8$M text files that have been transformed into just under $7$M tfrecord examples, each with $1024$ tokens (same as GPT-2). The validation set comes out to about $300$MB and consists of about $100$K text files that have been transformed into just about $90$K tfrecord examples, each with $1024$ tokens (also the same as GPT-2). . . # Code . . Since I’m using TPUs, the only real library that you can practically use right now would be Tensorflow. I didn’t want to have to go through the learning curve of learning how to make custom training loops and stuff in TF2 so I just stuck to using Keras. You can take a look at my training script (It’s pretty short) here. It’s pretty simple so I’m not going to copy over the entire training script, but I will talk about a few small code snippets. . I usually like to add a ptvsd breakpoint to my script so I can debug my training script locally with vscode before pushing it up to my VM . if args.debug: import ptvsd ptvsd.enable_attach(address=(&#39;localhost&#39;, 5678), redirect_output=True) ptvsd.wait_for_attach() breakpoint() . I’m using Weights&amp;Biases to keep track of my experiments and save checkpoints. . wandb.login() wandb.init(project=&#39;lm-finetuning&#39;, config=args, tags=args.tags) ... wandb_callback = WandbCallback(save_model=False) . Usually when you’re using a TPU with Keras, you pass in the IP address and port of the TPU to TPUClusterResolver, but you pass the name of the TPU itself to the resolver when using a TPU Pod. . resolver = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver(tpu=args.tpu) tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(resolver) tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system(resolver) . . Replicating GPT-2 . . I tried to use as many of the original hyperparameters that OpenAI used when I was replicating their $124$M parameter version of GPT-2, but I had to modify a few things so I could train everything in time. . Note: For some reason, the authors of the GPT-2 paper don’t state exactly what learning rates they used for training their models and instead just state “The learning rate of each model was manually tuned for the best perplexity on a 5% held-out sample of WebText”. . OpenAI trains their models for a total of $800$K iterations at a batch size of $512$ (Which comes out to around a total of $60$ epochs through the training set). . I trained my GPT-2 model for $1/8th$ the number of iterations that OpenAI trained theirs for (a total of around $100$K iterations) since each $100$K iteration training run took about $20$ hours to run on my 128-core TPU Pod. If I wanted to train GPT-2 for the same number of iterations as OpenAI, a single training run would have used up most of my one week of access to the pod. . Since my TPU pod was preemptible and resets every $24$ hours I usually had to resume my training run at least once and is the reason why all of these graphs usually have two or more training runs on them. . . Replicating GPT-2 . . So here’s my model that came really close to replicating GPT-2, the training perplexity is about $21.5$ at the end of the almost $90$K training iterations. For comparison, GPT-2 gets a training perplexity about $17.5$ ppl after about $800$K training iterations, so a difference of only about $4$ ppl. . I made a colab notebook showing how to use my pretrained GPT-2 model to generate text . . AdamW vs Adafactor . . I wanted to use the memory-saving Adafactor optimizer to make it easier to train larger language models but all of my Adafactor training runs were a lot (~5ppl IIRC) worse than using AdamW (This may be due to not using Adafactor’s momentum parameter or relative update scale, so this is something I want to look into more soon). . . Learning rates . . I started out with using Adam’s default learning rate of $1e-4$ but I quickly figured out that I could train my models a lot faster by using a higher learning rate like $1e-3$. . Section 2 of the GPT-3 paper lists the learning rates the OpenAI team used for different sized models when training GPT-3. They use a learning rate of $6e-4$ for the $124$M version of their model and decrease the learning rate with model size. . You can take a look at this partial training run to see the difference between training at different learning rates. . . Pretraining ALGPT-2 . . Since I was using the Huggingface Transformers repository’s implementations of GPT-2 and ALBERT, I just forked the repository and modified a few files to implement my ALGPT-2 model. You can take a look at all the changes that I had to make here, most of the changes are only to make ALGPT-2 compatible with the /Transformers library and to be able to use the useful abstractions that it gives you, but most of the important code is in the modelling_algpt2.py file in which I just copied over the contents of modelling_gpt2.py and changed a few parts of the code. I’m only showing the changes that I made to the Pytorch version of ALGPT-2 here, the changes in the TF version are pretty similar to the Pytorch version and can be seen here. . . Implementing parameter sharing . . Implementing parameter sharing only involves changing a few lines of code: . class ALGPT2Model(ALGPT2PreTrainedModel): def __init__(self, config): super().__init__(config) ... - self.h = nn.ModuleList([Block(config.n_ctx, config, scale=True) - for _ in range(config.n_layer)]) + self.h = Block(config.n_ctx, config, scale=True) ... def forward(self, ...): ... if past is None: past_length = 0 - past = [None] * len(self.h) + past = [None] * self.config.n_layer ... - for i, (block, layer_past) in enumerate(zip(self.h, past)): + for i in range(self.config.n_layer): if self.output_hidden_states: all_hidden_states = all_hidden_states + (hidden_states.view(*output_shape),) - - outputs = block( + outputs = self.h( hidden_states, layer_past=layer_past, attention_mask=attention_mask, head_mask=head_mask[i], use_cache=use_cache, ) ... . . Implementing a factorized embedding . . Adding a factorized embedding is a little more work: . In the config.json that you use for your ALGPT-2 model, you need to specify that you want to use the ALGPT-2 and you need to specify the dimension of the factorized embedding that you want to use: . { + &quot;architectures&quot;: [&quot;ALGPT2LMHeadModel&quot;], &quot;attn_pdrop&quot;: 0.1, &quot;bos_token_id&quot;: 50256, &quot;embd_pdrop&quot;: 0.1, &quot;eos_token_id&quot;: 50256, &quot;initializer_range&quot;: 0.02, &quot;layer_norm_epsilon&quot;: 1e-5, + &quot;model_type&quot;: &quot;algpt2&quot;, &quot;n_ctx&quot;: 1024, &quot;n_embd&quot;: 768, &quot;n_head&quot;: 12, &quot;n_layer&quot;: 12, &quot;n_positions&quot;: 1024, &quot;resid_pdrop&quot;: 0.1, &quot;summary_activation&quot;: null, &quot;summary_first_dropout&quot;: 0.1, &quot;summary_proj_to_labels&quot;: true, &quot;summary_type&quot;: &quot;cls_index&quot;, &quot;summary_use_proj&quot;: true, &quot;vocab_size&quot;: 50257, + &quot;embedding_size&quot;: 128 } . Back in modelling_algpt2.py, define the two factorized embedding matrices (the first second matrix that is really just a simple linear layer) . class ALGPT2Model(ALGPT2PreTrainedModel): def __init__(self, config): super().__init__(config) ... - self.wte = nn.Embedding(config.vocab_size, config.n_embd) - self.wpe = nn.Embedding(config.n_positions, config.n_embd) + self.wte = nn.Embedding(config.vocab_size, config.embedding_size) + self.wpe = nn.Embedding(config.n_positions, config.embedding_size) + self.projection_layer = nn.Linear(config.embedding_size, config.n_embd) ... def forward(self, ...): ... hidden_states = inputs_embeds + position_embeds + token_type_embeds + hidden_states = self.projection_layer(hidden_states) ... class ALGPT2LMHeadModel(ALGPT2PreTrainedModel): def __init__(self, config): super().__init__(config) ... - self.lm_head = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.vocab_size, bias=False) + self.dense = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.embedding_size) + self.lm_head = nn.Linear(config.embedding_size, config.vocab_size, bias=False) def forward(self, ...): ... - lm_logits = self.lm_head(hidden_states) + dense = self.dense(hidden_states) + lm_logits = self.lm_head(dense) ... . . Effect of layer-wise parameter sharing . . This version of ALGPT-2 has about $47$M parameters while GPT-2 has $124$M. This ALGPT-2 model with parameter sharing trains a lot faster than GPT-2 ($9$ hours vs $20$ hours for a $90$K iteration training run), but is consistently about $10$ ppl worse than GPT-2 ($31$ vs $21$ ppl). . This difference is quite a bit larger than the difference between ALBERT and BERT, but might be explained by masked language modelling being an easier task than autoregressive language modelling. Increasing the size of the ALGPT-2 model might make it more competitive with GPT-2. . . Effect of removing dropout . . I ran a partial training run on removing dropout from ALGPT-2. I didn’t run it for very long, but it looks like removing dropout gives you a slight improvement (~3ppl). . . Effect of factorized embeddings . . I ran three experiments for $90$K iterations with three different values for the factorized embedding ($128$, $256$, and $512$) as well as the baseline version without a factorized embedding. . Model ALGPT-2 ALGPT-2 512 ALGPT-2 256 ALGPT-2 128 . Parameters | 47M | 34M | 20M | 13M | . Time | ~9H | ~9H | ~9H | ~9H | . Perplexity | 31 | 31 | 34 | 38 | . There was practically no difference in the loss curves between the baseline and the $512$ run since the change in the number of parameters wasn’t that great. However, the training runs with factorized embeddings of sizes $256$ and $128$ were significantly worse than the baseline: $34$ and $38$ ppl respectively, a pretty big difference from the baseline of $31$ ppl. . . Effect of model size . . I only had the time to run one more full training run with ALGPT-2-medium (this one is comparable to the $345$M version of GPT-2). ALGPT-2-medium has about $66$M parameters and took twice as long as ALGPT-2 to train (a little more than $20$ hours). The larger model size made quite a big difference in performance, the training perplexity decreased $5$ppl from $31$ to $26$ ppl. . . Conclusion and next steps . . Well that’s pretty much everything that I did. After my TPU pod’s quota was used up, I started working on a few other things over the summer and just kept delaying writing up what I did for a couple of months until now. . There are a lot of things that I still want to work on or look into: . Training larger versions of ALGPT-2 | Removing or replacing the normalization layers in transformers | Working on distilling/shrinking language models with billions of parameters to make them more accessible | Apply something like PPLM to condition language models for few-shot inference (kinda like what GPT-3 does). | .

What are “flight rules”? . . Copied from: https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules . Flight Rules are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in manuals that list, step-by-step, what to do if X occurs, and why. Essentially, they are extremely detailed, scenario-specific standard operating procedures._ . NASA has been capturing our missteps, disasters and solutions since the early 1960s, when Mercury-era ground teams first started gathering “lessons learned” into a compendium that now lists thousands of problematic situations, from engine failure to busted hatch handles to computer glitches, and their solutions._ . — Chris Hadfield, An Astronaut’s Guide to Life. . . General tips . . https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe has some great best practices for training neural networks. Some of his tips include: . Look at the wrongly classified predictions of your network . . This can help tell you what might be wrong with your dataset or model. . Always set the random seed . . This will prevent (most, but not all!) variation in results between otherwise identical training runs. . Make a baseline and then increase the size of your model until it overfits . . Use a very simplified baseline to test that your code works correctly . . Use a simple model (e.g. a small resnet18 or linear regression) and confirm that your code works properly and as it is supposed to. . Overfit on a single batch . . Try using as small of a batch size as you can (if you’re using batch normalization, that would be a batch of two examples). Your loss should go down to zero within a few iterations. If it doesn’t, that means you have a problem somewhere in your code. . Be sure that you’re data has been correctly processed . . Visualize your input data right before the out = model(x) to be sure that the data being sent to the network is correct (data has normalized properly, augmentations have been applied correctly, etc) . Simple models -&gt; complex models . . In most cases, start with a simple model (eg: resnet18) then go on to using larger and more complex models (eg: SE-ResNeXt-101). . Start with a simple optimizer . . Adam is almost always a safe choice, It works well and doesn’t need extensive hyperparameter tuning. Kaparthy suggests using it with a learning rate of 3e-4. I usually start with SGD with a learning rate of 0.1 and a momentum of 0.9 for most image classification and segmentation tasks. . Change one thing at a time . . Change one hyperparameter/augmentation/architecture and see its effects on the performance of your network. Changing multiple things at a time won’t tell you what changes helped and which didn’t. . Regularize your model . . Get more data . . Training on more data will always decrease the amount of overfitting and is the easiest way to regularize a model . Data augmentation . . This will artificially increase the size of your dataset and is the next best thing to collecting more data. Be sure that the augmentations you use make sense in the context of the task (flipping images of text in an OCR task left to right will hurt your model instead of helping it). . Use a pretrained network . . Pretrained networks (usually on Imagenet) help jumpstart your model especially when you have a smaller dataset. The domain of the pretrained network doesn’t usually prevent it from helping although pretraining on a similar domain will be better. . Decrease the batch size . . Smaller batch sizes usually help increase regularization . Use early stopping . . Use the validation loss to only save the best performing checkpoint of the network after the val loss hasn’t gone down for a certain number of epochs . Squeeze out more performance out of the network . . Ensemble . . Ensemble multiple models either trained on different cross validation splits of the dataset or using different architectures. This always boosts performance by a few percentage points and gives you a more confident measure of the performance of the model on the dataset. Averaging metrics from models in an ensemble will help you figure out whether a change in the model is actually an improvement or random noise. . Use early stopping on the val metric . . Increase the size of the model until you overfit, then add regularization | augmentation on mask | correlation in ensembles | noise in ensembling | . . Another great resource for best practices when training neural networks is (http://amid.fish/reproducing-deep-rl). This article focused on best practices for deep rl, but most of its recommendations are still useful on normal machine learning. Some of these tips include: . Learn to deal with long iteration times . . Most normal programming (web development, IOS development, etc) iteration times usually range in the seconds, but iteration times in machine learning range from minutes to hours. This means that “experimenting a lot and thinking a little”, which is usually fine in other programming contexts, will make you waste a lot of time waiting for a training run to finish. Instead, spending more time thinking about what your code does and how it might not work will help you make less mistakes and waste less time. . Keep a log of what you’re working on . . Keeping records (tensorboard graphs/model checkpoints/metrics) of training runs and configurations will really help you out when figuring out what worked and what didn’t. Additionally, keeping track of what you’re working on and your mindset as you’re working through a problem will help you when you have to come back to your work days or weeks later. . Try to predict how your code will fail . . Doing this will cut down on the amount of failures that seem obvious in retrospect. I’ve sometimes had problems where I knew what was wrong with my code before going through the code to debug it. To stop making as many obvious mistakes, I wouldn’t start a new training run if I was uncertain about whether it would work, and then would find and fix what might have gone wrong. . Resources . . https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe | http://amid.fish/reproducing-deep-rl | . . Advanced tips . . some tips should be taken with a grain of salt | from: https://gist.github.com/bkkaggle/67bb9b5e6132e5d3c30e366c8d403369 | . . Basic architectures are sometimes better . . Always using the latest, most advanced, SOTA model for a task isn’t always the best choice. For example, Although more advanced semantic segmentation models like deeplab and pspnet are SOTA on datasets like PASCAL VOC and cityscapes, simpler architectures like U-nets are easier to train and adapt to new tasks and preform almost just as well on several recent kaggle competitions (https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/discussion/107824#latest-623920) (https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge/discussion/69291#latest-592781). . Be sure that code that you copied from Github or Stackoverflow is correct . . It’s a good idea to check code from Github and Stackoverflow to make sure it is correct and that you are using it in the correct way. In the Quora insincere questions classification Kaggle competition, a popular implementation of attention summed up the weighted features instead of weighting the actual features with the attention weights (https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/discussion/79911) (https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/discussion/76583#450210). . Don’t excessively tune hyperparameters . . Every time you tune hyperparameters on a validation set, you risk overfitting those hyperparameters to that validation set. If done correctly, the improvement from having better hyperparameters will outweigh the risk of having hyperparameters that don’t work well on the test set. . Set up cyclic learning rates correctly . . If you’re using a cyclic learning rate, be sure that the learning rate is at it’s lowest point when you have finished training. . Manually init layers . . Pytorch will automatically initialize layers for you, but depending on your activation function, you might want to use the correct gain for your activation function. Take a look at the pytorch documentation for more information. . Mixed/half precision training . . Mixed or half precision training lets you train on larger batch sizes and can speed up your training. Take a look at this if you want to simply use half precision training. . What is the difference between mixed and half precision training? . . Nvidia’s Volta and Turing GPUs contain tensor cores that can do fast fp16 matrix multiplications and significantly speed up your training. . “True” half precision training casts the inputs and the model’s parameters to 16 bit floats and computes everything using 16 bit floats. The advantages of this are that fp16 floats only use half the amount of vram as normal fp32 floats, letting you double the batch size while training. This is the fastest and most optimized way to take advantage of tensor cores, but comes at a cost. Using fp16 floats for the model’s parameters and batch norm statistics means that if the gradients are small enough, they can underflow and be replaced by zeros. . Mixed precision solves these problems by keeping a master copy of the model’s parameters in 32 bit floats. The inputs and the model’s parameters are still cast to fp16, but after the backwards pass, the gradients are copied to the master copy and cast to fp32. The parameters are updated in fp32 to prevent gradients from underflowing, and the new, updated master copy’s parameters are cast to fp16 and copied to the original fp16 model. Nvidia’s apex library recommends using mixed precision in a different way by casting inputs to tensor core-friendly operations to fp16 and keeping other operations in fp32. Both of these mixed precision approaches have an overhead compared to half precision training, but are faster and use less vram than fp32 training. . Take a look at (https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) for more information. . Apex won’t install on GCP’s deep learning vm . . This is a known issue with apex, take a look at (https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex/issues/259) for some possible solutions. . Resources . . If you’re using pytorch, Nvidia’s apex library (https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html) is the easiest way to start using mixed precision. If you want to read more about half and mixed precision training, take a look at https://forums.fast.ai/t/mixed-precision-training/20720 . gradient accumulation . . If you want to train larger batches on a gpu without enough vram, gradient accumulation can help you out. . The basic idea is this: call optimizer.step() every n minibatches, accumulating the gradients at each minibatch, effectively training on a minibatch of size batch_size x n. . Here’s a example showing how you could use gradient accumulation in pytorch, from (https://gist.github.com/thomwolf/ac7a7da6b1888c2eeac8ac8b9b05d3d3#file-gradient_accumulation-py): . model.zero_grad() # Reset gradients tensors for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(training_set): predictions = model(inputs) # Forward pass loss = loss_function(predictions, labels) # Compute loss function loss = loss / accumulation_steps # Normalize our loss (if averaged) loss.backward() # Backward pass if (i+1) % accumulation_steps == 0: # Wait for several backward steps optimizer.step() # Now we can do an optimizer step model.zero_grad() # Reset gradients tensors if (i+1) % evaluation_steps == 0: # Evaluate the model when we... evaluate_model() # ...have no gradients accumulated . If you want to read more about gradient accumulation, check out this blog post (https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) . multi gpu/machine training . . If you have multiple gpus, you can easily convert your current code to train your model on multiple gpus. Just follow the official tutorials on pytorch.org (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/data_parallel_tutorial.html). The only problem with this is that Pytorch’s build in DataParallel will gather the outputs from all the other gpus to gpu 1 to compute the loss and calculate gradients, using up more vram. There is an alternative to this though, just use this alternative balanced data parallel implementation (https://gist.github.com/thomwolf/7e2407fbd5945f07821adae3d9fd1312). . Take a look at (https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255#) for more information about multi gpu and distributed training. . determinism . . Pytorch will give you different results every time you run a script unless you set random seeds for python, numpy, and pytorch. Fortunately, doing this is very simple and only requires you to add a few lines to the top of each python file. There is a catch though, setting torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic to True will slightly slow down your network. . SEED = 42 np.random.seed(SEED) torch.manual_seed(SEED) torch.cuda.manual_seed(SEED) torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True . If you want a simple one-line way to do this, check out my pytorch_zoo library on github (https://github.com/bkkaggle/pytorch_zoo#seed_environmentseed42). . from pytorch_zoo.utils import seed_environment seed_environment(42) .

Initialization . Take a look at my post for more information. . . Normalization . Take a look at my post for an overview. . . Batch norm . . The original batch normalization paper put the batch norm layer before the activation function, recent research shows that putting the batch norm layer after the activation gives better results. A great article on batch norm and why it works can be found here (https://blog.paperspace.com/busting-the-myths-about-batch-normalization/). . You can’t use a batch size of 1 with batch norm . . Batch norm relies on the mean and variance of all the elements in a batch, it won’t work if you’re using a batch size of one while training, so either skip over any leftover batches with batch sizes of 1 or increase the batch size to atleast 2. . Be sure to use model.eval() with batch norm . . Run model.eval() before your validation loop to make sure pytorch uses the running mean and variance calculated over the training set. Also make sure to call model.train() before your training loop to start calculating the batch norm statistics again. You can read more about this at (https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/what-does-model-eval-do-for-batchnorm-layer/7146) . Resources . . http://mlexplained.com/2018/11/30/an-overview-of-normalization-methods-in-deep-learning/ is a really good blog post on the different types of normalizations and when to them. . . Common errors . . Pytorch . . Losses . . cross_entropy vs nll loss for multi-class classification . . Either pass the logits for a multi-class classification task to log_softmax first, then through the nll loss or pass the logits directly to cross_entropy. They will give you the same result, but cross_entropy is more numerically stable. Use softmax separately to convert logits into probabilities for prediction or for calculating metrics. Take a look at (https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/pytorch-crossentropy.html) for more information. . binary_cross_entropy vs binary_cross_entropy_with_logits for binary classification tasks . . Either pass the logits for a binary classification task to sigmoid first, then through binary_cross_entropy or pass the logits directly to binary_cross_entropy_with_logits. Just as the example above, they will give you the same result, but binary_cross_entropy is more numerically stable. Use sigmoid separately to conver the logits into probabilities for prediction or for calculating metrics. Again, take a look at (https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/pytorch-crossentropy.html) for more information. . Binary classification vs multi-class classification . . A binary classification task can also be represented as a multi-class classification task with two classes, positive and negative. They will give you the same result and should be numerically identical. . Here’s an example, taken from (https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/pytorch-crossentropy.html), on how you could do this: . &gt;&gt;&gt; import torch &gt;&gt;&gt; labels = torch.tensor([1, 0, 1], dtype=torch.float) &gt;&gt;&gt; probas = torch.tensor([0.9, 0.1, 0.8], dtype=torch.float) &gt;&gt;&gt; torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy(probas, labels) tensor(0.1446) &gt;&gt;&gt; labels = torch.tensor([1, 0, 1], dtype=torch.long) &gt;&gt;&gt; probas = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.9], ... [0.9, 0.1], ... [0.2, 0.8]], dtype=torch.float) &gt;&gt;&gt; torch.nn.functional.nll_loss(torch.log(probas), labels) tensor(0.1446) . . Pin memory in the dataloader . . Set pin_memory to true in your dataloader to speed up transferring your data from cpu to gpu. Take a look at this for more information (https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/when-to-set-pin-memory-to-true/19723). . model.eval() vs torch.no_grad() . . model.eval() will switch your dropout and batch norm layers to eval mode, turning off dropout and using the running mean and stddev for the batch norm layers. torch.no_grad() will tell pytorch to stop tracking operations, reducing memory usage and speeding up your evaluation loop. To use these properly, run model.train() before each training loop, run model.eval() before each evaluation loop, and wrap your evaluation loop with with torch.no_grad(): Take a look at this for more information (https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/model-eval-vs-with-torch-no-grad/19615/11). . What to use for num_workers in the dataloader . . If your gpu utilization fluctuates a lot and generally remains low (&lt; 90%), this might mean that your gpu is waiting for the cpu to finish processing all the elements in your batch and that num_workers might be your main bottleneck. num_workers in the dataloader is used to tell pytorch how many parallel workers to use to preprocess the data ahead of time. Set num_workers to the number of cores that you have in your cpu. This will fully utilize all your cpu cores to minimize the amount of time the gpu spends waiting for the cpu to process the data. If your gpu utilization still remains low, you should get more cpu cores or preprocess the data ahead of time and save it to disk. Take a look at these articles for more information: (https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/guidelines-for-assigning-num-workers-to-dataloader) and (https://stanford.edu/~shervine/blog/pytorch-how-to-generate-data-parallel). . Tensorboard . . Tensorboard is really useful when you want to view your model’s training progress in real time. Now that Pytorch 1.1 is out, you can now log metrics directly to tensorboard from Pytorch. . How to use it . . Follow these instructions for a quickstart (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_tutorial.html). . Use Tensorboard in a kaggle kernel . . Just copy this code snippet into a cell at the top of your kernel . !mkdir logs get_ipython().system_raw(&#39;tensorboard --logdir ./logs --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6006 &amp;&#39;) !ssh -o &quot;StrictHostKeyChecking no&quot; -R 80:localhost:6006 serveo.net . I also have another quickstart at my pytorch_zoo repository. . What do all the Tensorboard histograms mean? . .

Common errors . . RuntimeError: one of the variables needed for gradient computation has been modified by an inplace operation . . In place operations and operations on slices of tensors can cause problems with Pytorch’s autograd. To fix this, convert your inplace operation, x[:, 0, :] += 1, to a non inplace operation, x[:, 0, :] = x[:, 0, :].clone() + 1, and use .clone() to avoid problems with operations on tensor slices. Take a look at (https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/encounter-the-runtimeerror-one-of-the-variables-needed-for-gradient-computation-has-been-modified-by-an-inplace-operation/836) for more information. . Creating MTGP constants failed error . .

Torchtext is Pytorch’s official NLP library, The library’s official docs are the best way to get started with the library, but are a bit limited and there are some blog posts that help you get a better sense of how to use the library: . https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/torchtext_translation_tutorial.html | https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/text_sentiment_ngrams_tutorial.html | https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transformer_tutorial.html | http://anie.me/On-Torchtext/ | http://mlexplained.com/2018/02/08/a-comprehensive-tutorial-to-torchtext/ | http://mlexplained.com/2018/02/15/language-modeling-tutorial-in-torchtext-practical-torchtext-part-2/ | https://towardsdatascience.com/use-torchtext-to-load-nlp-datasets-part-i-5da6f1c89d84 | https://towardsdatascience.com/use-torchtext-to-load-nlp-datasets-part-ii-f146c8b9a496 | https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/torchtext_translation_tutorial.html | . . Sort batches by length . . Your recurrent models will train best if all the examples in a batch have similar lengths. Since all the examples in a batch are padded with zeros to the length of the longest example, grouping examples with identical or similar lengths will make your model more efficient and waste less of the GPU’s memory. Use the iterator’s sort_key attribute to tell it to group examples of similar lengths into each batch. If you’re using pack_padded_sequence, set sort_within_batch to True since pack_padded_sequence expects examples in a batch to be in ascending order. Take a look at this for more information. . https://github.com/pytorch/text/issues/303 | . . Pretrained embeddings . . If you want to use a pretrained embedding like word2vec or glove, you will have to load in the pretrained vectors and update the field’s vectors. . # Load in the vectors vectors = torchtext.vocab.Vectors(&#39;/path/to/vectors&#39;) # Create the text field text_field = data.Field(tokenize=tokenizer, lower=True, batch_first=True, include_lengths=True) # Built the vocab for the field using the train dataset text_field.build_vocab(train_dataset) # Set the vectors of the field to be the pretrained vectors text_field.vocab.set_vectors(vectors.stoi, vectors.vectors, vectors.dim) . Take a look at this for more information. . Serializing datasets . . If you’re working with large datasets that take time to load and process, being able to serialize and save processed datasets to disk is a really nice feature. Unfortunately, this feature is still a work in progress (the issue was created in 2017, and there doesn’t seem to be that much work being done on torchtext as of late 2019), so the only way to do this at the moment is to follow this article. . Kaggle . . Here are some of tips and tricks I picked up while participating in kaggle competitions. . Tips . . Trust your local validation . . Your score on your local validation set should be the most important, and sometimes the only, metric to pay attention to. Creating a validation set that you can trust to tell you whether you are or are not making progress is very important. . Optimize for the metric . . The goal of kaggle competitions is to get the highest (or lowest, depending on the metric) score on a specific metric. To do this, you might need to modify your model’s loss function. For example, if the competition metric penalizes mistakes on rare classes more than common classes, oversampling or weighting the loss in favor of those classes can force the model to optimize for that metric. . Something that works for someone might not work for you . . Just because someone says on the discussion forum that a particular technique or module works better for them doesn’t automatically mean that it will work for you. . Tricks . . Removing negative samples from a dataset is equivalent to loss weighting . . This usually works well and is easier to do than loss weighting. . Thresholding . . Using the optimal threshold on a dataset can lead to brittle results . . If you choose thresholds for (binary) classification problems by choosing whatever value gives you the optimal score on a validation set, the threshold might be overfitting to the specific train-val split or to the specific architecture/hyperparameters. This can have two effects. First, the optimial threshold you found on the val set might not be the optimal threshold on the held out test set, decreasing your score. Second, this makes comparing results between runs with different model architectures or hyperparameters more difficult. Using different thresholds means that a model that is actually worse might get a higher score than a better model if you find a ‘lucky’ threshold. . Shakeup . . Shakeup prediction is a powerful tool to predict the likely range of scores for your model when evaluated on an unknown test set. It was first introduced by the winner of a kaggle competition as a way to stabilize his models in (https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/discussion/36809).

            "content": ". Part 1: Best Practices for Finetuning Large Transformer Language models . Part 2: How I (almost) replicated OpenAI’s GPT-2 (124M version) . Background . . A few months ago I started working on a research project on how to best finetune GPT2-like language models for text generation. Once I ran a few experiments on that, I wanted to expand the scope of the project and try to pretrain my own, more efficient language model from scratch. I got access to a 128-core TPUv3 pod from the Tensorflow Reseach Cloud and used it to pretrain GPT2-124M to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI’s results (my pretrained model used was trained for about $1/8$th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got $21$ ppl on OpenWebText compared to $17$ ppl for OpenAI’s model), and then pretrained an ALBERT-style GPT2 (that I’m calling ALGPT2) language model with a factorized input embedding and parameter sharing that would reduce the number of paramters from 124M to around 12M. . Unfortunately, ALGPT2 doesn’t generate coherent, natural sounding text as well as GPT2 (ALGPT2 gets $31$ ppl on OpenWebText compared to $21$ ppl for my pretrained GPT2 model), but I’m writing this series of blog posts to go through everything I’ve learned over the last few months. . I have a cleaned-up version of my codebase on Github here, and my original codebase with all my notes here. . You can take a look at my Weights&amp;Biases workspace with all my runs here. . . Objectives . . I don’t usually have access to a lot of compute (I mostly just use Google Colab) so I started out by limiting the scope of my project to finetuning or running inference on GPT2. I wrote down a few notes on what I wanted to look into: . . If I wanted to finetune a LM to generate text of a specific style/content, what good defaults would I choose? | Find best practices or good defaults for finetuning tranformer language models for text generation. | Understand the effect of context len, model, and dataset size on generating coherent text | . . Data . . I ran most of the finetuning experiments on WikiText-2, which was small enough (~10mb on disk with a total of ~2m words) that I could run experiments fast enough (usually within 5-10m) on the v100 or p100 that I usually got through Colab. . I also ran a few experiments using WikiText-103 (~500mb, 100m words) but these were a lot harder to do because the size of the dataset forced me to use smaller batch sizes which took too long. . Loading in larger datasets (like WikiText-103) into memory can become pretty inefficient because of Python’s overhead. IIRC, if you want to load the entire WikiText-103 train set into memory with Python and tokenize the whole thing in one go using Huggingface’s Tokenizers library and the GPT2 byte-level BPE tokenizer, it takes about 10 minutes and uses up about 60GB of RAM (Most of the time is spent tokenizing and most of the RAM is used loading the file into memory). Using something like Apache Arrow like the Huggingface NLP library should make this a whole lot more efficient. . The WikiText datasets are stored as a single text file, with one Wikipedia article per line. Another more efficient way of processing the data would be to load in the file line-by-line and tokenize each line in parallel using the Huggingface tokenizer library’s batch_encode_plus() function. This is a lot faster and efficient (taking up only 2GB of RAM and 2 minutes) but has its own drawbacks. batch_encode_plus() truncates sequences beyond that have more than context_len tokens and leaves sequences that are smaller than context_len as is, which means that you need to zero-pad the sequences that are smaller than context_len and discard any portion of a sequence beyond the first context_len tokens. For datasets that are used to benchmark the performance of a wide range of language models, this can lead to your model being harder to compare against other models that follow the commonly used convention of just tokenizing the entire dataset and chunking it into sequences of context_len length. . I wanted to make sure the way that I preprocessed the data made sure that the models that I finetuned on WikiText-2 and WikiText-103 would be comparable to other models, so in my code, I load in the entire dataset, tokenize it, and split it into contigous sequences of length context_len. There are a few other preprocessing-related factors that can affect how comparable results between different models can be, I wrote a post on the topic a while ago, check it out if you’re interested. . . Frameworks . . I originally wrote all my code in vanilla Pytorch. I wanted to try using Colab’s free TPUv3 board that has 8 TPU cores each with 16GB of RAM, each of which is a little slower that a single V100. Using the entire TPU board should be at least as fast as using a cluster of 8 V100s but at a much lower cost. . I tried using Pytorch Lightning to see if it would help make the Pytorch model run on the Colab TPU more easily, but after about a week of trying to use the library I switched over to having two training scripts; One in plain Pytorch and one in Tensorflow2.0 with Keras — Even though Pytorch Lightning was very well designed, the time and effort required to make sure the framework is working the way that I want wasn’t worth it in the end. . This was my first time working with TF/Keras since around early 2018 when I switched to Pytorch (back in the 0.3 days when you still had to use Variable). TF2.0 is a lot better now than it used to be two or three years ago but still doesn’t feel as intuitive or easy to use as Pytorch. The documentation looks pretty good at first glance but there were a lot of gaps in the documentation when I was trying to figure out how to write and decode TFRecord files and scale my Keras code to TPUs and TPU pods. . Trying to get gradient accumulation to work with TPUs was especially hard, IIRC grad accumulation isn’t natively supported in Keras but there are a lot of independent implementations that people have open-sourced on Github, but they didn’t work well with TPUs. . I used the Huggingface/Transformers repository for the GPT-2 model and Weights&amp;Biases to track all the experiments that I ran. . Fun fact, I ran into a problem with Colab’s TPU a couple of times where I was silently downgraded from a TPUv3 to a TPUv2 and as a result I was getting a lot of OOM errors for a model and batch size that was working perfectly just a few hours ago. Colab doesn’t really advertise this and makes it almost impossible to know if you have been downgraded :( . Pytorch recently released Pytorch/XLA which is supposed to let you run Pytorch code on TPUs with only a few changes to your code. I spent quite a bit of time to try and make this work but using it is still a lot more complex than just using a GPU. . Pytorch/XLA is a lot slower on Colab, which probably has something to do with Colab’s network connection to the TPUs being a lot slower. Using some operations that aren’t supported by Pytorch/XLA can have a pretty drastic impact on the speed of your program, so if your code is running unusually slow on a TPU, unsupported ops are a common culprit. For example, I was trying to use the memory-saving Adafactor optimizer on Pytorch/XLA but since I was using a non-Pytorch operation in one part of the code (using Python’s sqrt() function instead of torch.sqrt()), a single iteration was taking ~10 seconds compared to 10 iterations/second for SGD. . TPU support for Pytorch works pretty differently from TPU support for Tensorflow. Each TPU has a powerful dedicated CPU and several 100GBs of RAM for data processing, so whenever you run TF code on a TPU, your data gets copied to each core’s CPU (unless you use TFRecord files, in which case each core’s CPU downloads and processes data directly from your cloud bucket) and gets processed there. By doing it in this way, you only need to rent a small cloud instance (like a n1-standard-1) and scaling your code from a single TPU board with 8 cores to a part of a TPU pod is (relatively) painless. . On the other hand, Pytorch/XLA can’t currently use the TPU’s CPU and instead has to replicate the data $8$ times on your own VM for an $8$ core TPU board. If you want to use Pytorch/XLA for a TPU pod, you have to create a VM group with one host VM for each $8$ core TPU board. This means that Pytorch/XLA isn’t currently practical for large scale training, but it looks like the next version of TPUs will be a lot more optimized for Pytorch. It works alright for a small dataset like WikiText-2 but when I tried finetuning on WikiText-103 (~500mb, 100m words) I needed to upgrade my VM to have 80+ GB of RAM. . . Finetuning . . I wasn’t able to finetune GPT2-1.5b on a TPU with the AdamW optimizer even with the TPU’s built in bfloat16 support, so most of the experiments that I ran were with the memory-saving Adafactor optimizer with beta1 set to zero to disable momentum. Enabling momentum might increase the performance of the Adafactor optimizer, but would also require storing an extra momentum value for each parameter and would make it harder to train larger models. . Fun fact: The AdamW optimizer implementation in Google’s official BERT repository excludes layernorm and bias parameters from weight decay and AFAICT is the only optimizer that does so. I tried running a few experiments with and without finetuning these parameters and didn’t find any significant difference in performance. . Most of the GPU experiments I did were with NVidia’s Apex library, with its $01$ mixed precision setting. I also tried running a few experiments on using only FP16, but the gradients would explode or vanish and the model wouldn’t train. . I have a forked version of Huggingface’s Transformers repository where I’ve implemented gradient checkpointing for GPT-2. I haven’t been maintaining it but you can see all the changes that I did to make it work (it’s really only a few lines of code) here. I tried training GPT2-XL with grad checkpointing which IIRC worked with a smaller context length of 256 but still threw OOM errors when finetuning at a context length of 1024. . For small datasets like WikiText-2, (WikiText-2 consists of about 2 million words, so it’s actually on the larger size for datasets that you might collect yourself) the model usually overfits within the first 1-3 epochs, so most of the experiments that I did trained for a single epoch — there really is no performance benefit to finetuning for any longer. I set the learning rate for all of my finetuning experiments to $5e-5$ (This was just the first value I tried, no hyperparameter tuning involved) and linearly increased the learning rate from $0$ to $5e-5$ over the first 10% of the training iterations and then linearly decayed it to zero over the rest of the training iterations. . Note: The Adafactor paper shows that warmup is strongly recommended to stabilize training, take a look at the paper for more details . If you want to finetune GPT2 on a dataset like WikiText-2, there’s a relationship between the batch size, learning rate, and the number of training iterations that you need to adjust to train effectively and avoid overfitting or plateauing. There’s a pretty important ratio that you need to keep constant between the batch size and the learning rate. A larger batch size means that there are fewer gradient updates performed if you keep the number of training iterations constant. . I have a WandB report showing a few different training runs on WikiText-2 with different sized GPT2 models and context lengths. The results aren’t really that surprising, finetuning larger models at larger context lengths increases perplexity significantly. . I wrote a quick Colab notebook on how to finetune and evaluate on WikiText-2. .",

            "content": "I originally wrote this blog post for the PyTorch blog which is available here (Use this link to access my article with my friend link so you don’t need to worry about Medium paywalling my article) . . PyTorch Zoo is a collection of modules and utilities that I’ve found to be useful when working on machine learning projects and competitions. PyTorch Zoo contains several modules not available in PyTorch, like cyclical momentum and squeeze-and-excitation, as well as useful utilities like the ability to send notifications and set random seeds to get consistent results. PyTorch Zoo is meant to provide high-quality reference implementations of modules that don’t have official implementations in PyTorch and save you time that would have otherwise been spent searching for implementations on Github or coding the module yourself. . . &lt;/img&gt; . From: https://github.com/bkkaggle/pytorch_zoo . . The library is open-source on Github and is available as a pip package. Just run: . pip install pytorch_zoo . to install it in your local development environment and check out the documentation for in-depth examples on all the library’s features. I’ve included quite a few modules in PyTorch Zoo, so I’ll try to focus only on some of the ones that I found to be the most interesting for this blog post. . . Cyclical Momentum . . Cyclical momentum, which was first proposed in the same paper as cyclical learning rates 1, is usually used together with cyclical learning rates. It decreases the amount of momentum while the learning rate increases and increases the amount of momentum while the learning rate decreases, stabilizing training and allowing for the use of higher learning rates. Here’s an example of how you could use cyclical momentum just like a normal PyTorch scheduler: . optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1, momentum=0.9) scheduler = torch.optim.CyclicMomentum(optimizer) data_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(...) for epoch in range(10): for batch in data_loader: scheduler.batch_step() train_batch(...) . . Squeeze and Excitation . . Squeeze and Excitation modules 2 3 can be easily integrated into existing models by just adding one of these modules after each convolutional block and improves the model’s performance without significantly impacting training time. All three variants of the squeeze-and-excitation block that were proposed in the original papers are available in PyTorch Zoo, see the documentation for specific examples on how to use each one. Here’s an example of how you could use SqueezeAndExcitation in a convolutional block . class Encoder(nn.Module): def __init__(self, in_ch, out_ch, r): super(Encoder, self).__init__() self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_ch, out_ch, 3, padding=1) self.se = SqueezeAndExcitation(out_ch, r) def forward(self, x): x = F.relu(self.conv(x), inplace=True) x = self.se(x) return x . . Utilities . . PyTorch Zoo also has a small range of utilities to make it easier to follow PyTorch best practices when doing things like saving a model to disk and setting random seeds, as well as easy to use one-liners to do things like sending push notifications when a training run ends. . Here’s an example of how you could use some of these utilities: . # Send a notification to your phone directly with IFTTT (https://ifttt.com/) notifying # you when a training run ends or at the end of an epoch. notify({&#39;value1&#39;: &#39;Notification title&#39;, &#39;value2&#39;: &#39;Notification body&#39;}, key=[IFTTT_KEY]) # Automatically set random seeds for Python, numpy, and Pytorch to make sure your results can be reproduced seed_envirionment(42) # Print how much GPU memory is currently allocated gpu_usage(device, digits=4) # GPU Usage: 6.5 GB # Print out the number of parameters in a Pytorch model print(n_params(model)) # 150909673 # Save a model for a particular cross-validation fold to disk save_model(model, fold=0) . .

This is my second blog post in the series, and this time I’m taking notes on evaluation metrics in NLP. . Most of the content of this post comes from Chip Huyen’s really good article in The Gradient on Evaluation methods for language models and the Deep Learning book, so a big thank you to the authors and editors for making this perplexing (pun intended) topic easy to understand. . let me be 100% clear here, I don’t want to come across like I’m taking someone else’s ideas and publishing them as my own. The purpose of this blog post is to take notes for myself so I can come back to this when I inevitably forget how to calculate perplexity. . Also, take a look at this for another good look at perplexity and the effect of tokenization on it. . . Background . . Language models like GPT2 try to predict the next word (or subword/character, we’ll use the term token in this blog post), in a context of tokens. . For example, when predicting the next word in the sentence &quot;I am a computer science and machine learning&quot;, the probability of the next work being enthusiast could be represented by . P(enthusiast∣I am a computer science and machine learning)P(enthusiast | I space am space a space computer space science space and space machine space learning)P(enthusiast∣I am a computer science and machine learning) . The probability of a sentence $s$, where $s$ is a sequence of n tokens $(w_{0}, w_{1}, … w_{n})$ can be represented as .

P(s)=p(w1)p(w2∣w1)p(w3∣w1,w2)...p(wn∣w1w2...wn−1)P(s) = p(w_{1})p(w_{2} | w_{1})p(w_{3} | w_{1}, w_{2})...p(w_{n} | w_{1} w_{2} ... w_{n - 1})P(s)=p(w1​)p(w2​∣w1​)p(w3​∣w1​,w2​)...p(wn​∣w1​w2​...wn−1​) . . Information Theory . . The amount of information given by a discrete event $x$ is calculated by the Self-Information equation 1 . I(x)=−log P(x)I(x) = -log space P(x)I(x)=−log P(x) . Information is normally written in one of two units, $nats$, in which case the logarithm has a base of $e$ or $bits$, with a base of $2$. . One $nat$ encodes the “amount of information gained by observing an event with a probability of $ frac {1} {e}$.” 1 . . Shannon Entropy . . Shannon entropy is the extension of the Self-Information equation to probability distributions and is a way to “quantify the amount of uncertainty in an entire probability distribution.” 1 . H(x)=Ex∼P[log P(x)]H(x) = mathbb E_{x sim P} [log space P(x)]H(x)=Ex∼P​[log P(x)] . It’s a measure of how much information, on average is produced for each letter of a language 2 and (if calculated in units of $bits$) can also be defined as the average number of binary digits required to encode each letter in a vocabulary. . In NLP, the evaluation metric, Bits-per-character (BPC), is really just the entropy of a sequence, calculated with units of bits instead of nats. . Entropy calculated across language models that are trained over different context lengths aren’t exactly comparable, LMs with a longer context len will have more information from which to predict the next token. For example, given the sentence I work with machine learning it should be easier for a LM to predict the next word in the sequence I work with machine, than with just the first word: I. (This is actually a major pain point when I was trying to reproduce gpt2’s ppl numbers on wikitext2 and wikitext103, it’s still unclear how the paper evaluated the ppl values on the tests sets for both datasets.) . . Perplexity . . Perplexity: A measurement of how well a probability distribution or probability model predicts a sample 3 . Perplexity is usually calculated with units of $nats$, so calculate it with the equation: $PPL = e^{loss}$ . . Dealing with different tokenization schemes . . If you want to convert the perplexity between models that have been trained using different tokenization schemes and have a different number of tokens that the LM can predict, multiply the cross-entropy loss of the first language model by the ratio of $( text{n tokens first model} / text{n tokens seconds model})$ . The adjusted perplexity value can be found with 4 : . adj_ppl=eloss∗(#tokens/#tokens for other model)adj _ppl = e^{loss * ( text{ #tokens} / text{ #tokens for other model})}adj_ppl=eloss∗(#tokens/#tokens for other model) . .

            "title": "Normalization",
            "content": "Updated on Jun 26, 2020: Fix BatchNorm and LayerNorm equations . . Purpose . . The purpose of these series of blog posts is to be a place to store my (still in-progress!) notes about topics in machine learning, help me keep track of everything I’ve learned over the last three years, and to practice my Latex skills. . I’m starting this series of blog posts by writing down my notes on the different types of normalization in neural networks. Let’s see how this goes. . . Why normalize? . . Not normalizing input activations means that layers can transform activations to have very large or small means and standard deviations and cause the gradients to explode or vanish. . . Batch Normalization . . Arxiv . Tl;dr: Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each feature in the batch across the batch dimension and normalize to have a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$, then scale the resulting activations by two learned parameters $ gamma$ and $ beta$ . . For a mini-batch of activations B={x1...xm}, text{For a mini-batch of activations} space B = { { x_{1} ... x_{m} } },For a mini-batch of activations B={x1​...xm​}, . μB←1m∑i=1mxi mu_{B} leftarrow frac{1} {m} sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{i}μB​←m1​i=1∑m​xi​ . σB2←1m∑i=1m(xi−μB)2 sigma_{B}^{2} leftarrow frac{1} {m} sum_{i=1}^{m} (x_{i} - mu_{B}) ^ 2σB2​←m1​i=1∑m​(xi​−μB​)2 . x^←xi−μBσB2+ϵ hat{x} leftarrow frac {x_{i} - mu_{B}} { sqrt { sigma_{B}^{2} + epsilon}}x^←σB2​+ϵ . ​xi​−μB​​ . yi←γxi^+βy_{i} leftarrow gamma hat{x_{i}} + betayi​←γxi​^​+β . In Batch Normalization 1, you first calculate the mean and variance of the input tensor across the batch dimension, then subtract the input tensor by the mean $ mu_{B}$ and divide by the standard deviation (plus a small value to prevent dividing by $0$) $ sqrt { sigma_{B}^{2}}$ to restrict the activations of the neural network to having a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$ . You then scale the activations with learned parameters by rescaling the zero-mean activations by two learned parameters $ beta$ and $ gamma$. . The original paper claimed that the reason batch norm worked so well was by reducing internal covariate shift (“The change in the distribution of the input values to a learning algorithm” link), but more recent papers have disputed this and given other reasons to why it works so well. . This lets the network choose the mean and standard deviation that it wants for its activations before they are passed to a convolutional or fully connected layer. . One question that I’ve had over and over again related to batch norm is where exactly to place it in a network, and it looks like other people have had the same question. . The original paper places the batch norm layer after the convolutional layer and before the non-linearity, which is the default used by torchvision and other model zoos. It also claims that using batch norm can reduce or eliminate the need to use dropout, so the order could look like either of these: . Conv→BN→ReLU→DropoutConv rightarrow BN rightarrow ReLU rightarrow DropoutConv→BN→ReLU→Dropout . Conv→BN→ReLUConv rightarrow BN rightarrow ReLUConv→BN→ReLU . Some benchmarks show that placing the batch norm layer after the non-linearity can perform better 2 . Conv→ReLU→BN→DropoutConv rightarrow ReLU rightarrow BN rightarrow DropoutConv→ReLU→BN→Dropout . but this isn’t widely used. . One major disadvantage with this is that the pre-normalized activations must be saved for the backwards pass. This means that if you add a batchnorm layer for each convolutional layer in your network (which is a common practice), your network will need about twice the memory to store the same batch size into the GPU. Beyond using up more GPU memory, batch norm doesn’t work with batch sizes of 1, and doesn’t perform well with small batch sizes since the calculated mean and standard deviation for each batch will change a lot from batch to batch and gives the model a very noisy estimate of the true distribution. . Another thing you should keep in mind about batch norm is that when training on multiple gpus or machines, that by default, each gpu will keep its own mean and standard deviation parameters, which can be a problem if the per-gpu batch size is too low. There are synchronized batch norm implementations available that should fix this. Another thing to keep in mind is what mean and standard deviation values to use when evaluating on a test set or finetuning on a new dataset. . Other work, like In-Place Batch normalization 3 reduces the memory usage by recomputing the pre-batchnorm activations from the post-batchnorm activations, while others, like Fixup Initialization 4, MetaInit 5, LSUV 6, and Delta Orthogonal 7 use special initialization strategies to remove the need for batch normalization. . . Layer normalization . . Arxiv . Tl;dr: Calculate the mean and standard deviation for element in the batch across the feature dimension and normalize to have a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$, then scale the resulting activations by two learned parameters $ gamma$ and $ beta$ . . For activations in a batch of shape $x_{ij}$, where $i$ is the batch dimension and $j$ is the feature dimension (assuming this is a simple feedforward network), . μi←1m∑j=1mxij mu_{i} leftarrow frac{1} {m} sum_{j=1}^{m} x_{ij}μi​←m1​j=1∑m​xij​ . σi2←1m∑j=1m(xij−μi)2 sigma_{i}^{2} leftarrow frac{1} {m} sum_{j=1}^{m} (x_{ij} - mu_{i}) ^ 2σi2​←m1​j=1∑m​(xij​−μi​)2 . x^←xij−μiσi2+ϵ hat{x} leftarrow frac {x_{ij} - mu_{i}} { sqrt { sigma_{i}^{2} + epsilon}}x^←σi2​+ϵ . ​xij​−μi​​ . yij←γxij^+βy_{ij} leftarrow gamma hat{x_{ij}} + betayij​←γxij​^​+β . Layer Normalization 8, is almost identical to batch normalization except that layer norm normalizes across the feature dimension instead of the batch dimension. This means that layer norm calculates a mean and standard deviation value for for each element in the batch instead of for each feature over all elements in the batch. . Layer norm is used mostly for RNNs and Transformers and has the same GPU memory requirements as batch norm. . . Resources . . These are some of the amazing and very helpful blog posts, tutorials, and deep dives that have helped me learn about the topic and write this blog post. . https://mlexplained.com/2018/11/30/an-overview-of-normalization-methods-in-deep-learning/ | https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/1959 | . .

            "title": "What Is Ai",
            "content": "Google Doc . This was originally a report I made for my ELA class that I’ve formatted into a blog post. Since I had to create the report in a specific way for the assignment, some of the information here has isn’t really relevant to most people who would be reading this blog post and is less technical. . Artificial Intelligence, or as it’s more commonly known, AI, has been said to either transform our world into a utopia, or bring about our doom. With so many widely publicized news stories about AI systems that can generate convincingly human-like text, defeat world champions at board games that were previously thought to be too hard for a computer, or generate images of human faces that appear indistinguishable from the real things, it can seem that we are close to a point at which AI may become self-aware and pose a threat to humans. . To truly understand if these fears of AI surpassing human intelligence and taking over the world are justified, we must first know, what is AI? . What is AI? What is AI? For some, it conjures up pictures from movies like Terminator and The Matrix, of robots gaining sentience and taking over the world. The term “Artificial Intelligence” was coined in 1956, by computer scientist John McCarthy, who, in his article, defines AI as “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially computer programs” 1. Other people define AI in similar terms, saying that “AI is a collection of methods and ideas for building software that can do some of the things that humans can do with their brains” 2. . What is the history of AI? The field of AI started in the years after the end of World War II. In 1947, the famous British mathematician and code-breaker Alan Turing gave a lecture on programming computers to develop intelligent machines 1. Turing was also the creator of the Turing test, a test to determine “a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior similar to that of a human.” . In the 1960s, researchers at MIT developed a chatbot (a chatbot is a computer program that attempts to carry on a conversation with a human) called ELIZA which was able to pass the Turing test and show that it is possible for a computer program to create human-like text. . In the 1970s and 80s, neural networks, a family of algorithms that are loosely based on the neurons in a human brain, were developed. Neural networks excelled at learning patterns from large amounts of data and were used to automate tasks like reading addresses from envelopes. . In the 1990s and 2000s more progress was made in solving large problems in AI. In 1996, IBM’s Deep Blue computer beat the world’s best chess player, and in 2000, Honda released ASIMO, a humanoid robot that was capable of walking and recognizing objects and gestures. . In 2010, IBM’s Watson computer beat the best human competitors on the trivia game show Jeopardy!. Since around 2012, a lot of AI research is being done in machine learning - deep learning in particular. Deep learning involves stacking layers of neural networks on top of each other to create “deep” neural networks. Neural networks are now used in most of the widely used AI applications today - digital assistants like Siri and Alexa, self-driving cars, and recommendation algorithms from Netflix, Youtube, and other social media companies are all using neural networks in some part. Neural networks currently work better than other AI techniques in many areas because of their ability to learn from large amounts of data and because of the increasing amount of computational power available to train them 3 . . What are the different types of AI? AI is not one single area of research, it consists of many different branches that each have different views on how to build artificially intelligent systems. There are two main types of artificial intelligence, narrow AI and general AI. 2 . Most of the advances in AI have been in narrow AI: getting computers to learn how to do certain tasks as good as or better than a human. Although computers can now do certain tasks better than humans, narrow AI systems are highly specialized - a system designed for classifying images can’t be used to control a robot arm 2 . One example of a branch of narrow AI would be Machine Learning, or ML. Machine learning involves teaching a computer to iteratively learn to solve a task by giving it a large amount of data to learn from. In this way, machine learning lets computers learn how to do tasks without explicitly giving it instructions on how to do so 3 . . General AI involves computers that can generalize to a wide variety of tasks like humans do. So far, there has been very little progress on developing general AI, so any general AI systems are very likely decades away, if not more. 2 . In what areas is AI being used? AI is being used by researchers in a wide variety of areas and for a wide variety of purposes. AI is being used in healthcare to predict the spread of the Coronavirus epidemic, predict with radiologist-level accuracy whether a person has cancer from an x-ray scan, and to more accurately predict the folded structure of proteins, which is a crucial step in designing new life-saving medicines. . AI is also being used by companies in three main ways. First, AI is being used for RPA (Robotic Process Automation), automating time-consuming administrative tasks like transferring data from emails to spreadsheets and databases. Second, AI is being used to gain cognitive insights (which involves using algorithms to “detect patterns in vast volumes of data and interpret their meaning”) by predicting what items customers will buy next and identifying credit card fraud in real time. Finally, AI is being used for cognitive engagement (using AI to engage with potential customers) with chatbots providing customer service at any time and creating customized care plans. 4 . Conclusion Artificial intelligence today is limited to computers that can do certain tasks, sometimes as good as or even better than what a human could do, but highly specialized and limited to the scope of the task that it was trained to do. Once one knows the limitations of AI as we have it today, the claims that AI is close to surpassing human intelligence and taking over the world seem unfounded. .
