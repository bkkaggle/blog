Hi, I'm a 1B Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I use this blog as a place to keep my WIP notes and thoughts about things that I'm learning about and want to reference at some later time. Because of this, most of the material in this blog is pretty unpolished and sparse, but I hope that some of the material here can be useful in some way.

Please contact me through my discord: `bilal2vec#8916`, [email](mailto:bilal.khan1@uwaterloo.ca), or my [other online profiles](https://linktr.ee/bkkaggle) (i go by @bilal2vec on most online platforms) if you have any suggestions, ideas, or comments.
