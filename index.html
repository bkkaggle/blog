I use this blog as a place to keep my wip notes and thoughts about things that I've learned about before and want to reference at some later time. Because of this, most of the material in this blog is pretty unpolished and sparse. The point of keeping this blog is something like what Frieda Rong [wrote](https://friedeggs.github.io/resources/) that stuck with meâ€”that unpolished, intermediate results that haven't yet been "cleaned up" can have their own value and offer something useful and different to what is already out there.

I hope that some of the material here can be useful in some way, and please [contact me](https:/bkkaggle.github.io) if you have any suggestions, ideas, or comments.
