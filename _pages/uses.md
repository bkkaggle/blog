### Desk
 
I have a 75cm Ikea LINNMON table top+legs which is pretty nice and large but I'd recommend anyone to get a stronger set of table legs since mine could be sturdier. I have two Ikea TERTIAL desk lamps that I use with two 1200 lumen 5000K bulbs which are pretty bright and simulate daylight pretty well, which is especially helpful during the winter. I sit on a Ikea JÄRVFJÄLLET ergonomic chair. I'd really recommend this chair for anyone who doesn't want to go for a herman miller but still wants a chair that's comfortable to sit on for *many, many* hours. 

I use the 13" 2019 macbook pro along with a 32" Samsung UJ590 4K monitor and a 27" LG 27MP58VQ-P 1080p monitor. I used to use the 27" one full time until I got the second monitor so i know just keep this one off to the side to hold extra chrome tabs/arxiv papers/discord. I bought an ipad with the apple pencil for school (thanks academic readiness bursary) because I eventually wore down my old surface pro 3's pen nib until it just stopped working. The ipad was a really good ~freebie~investment for working on math assignments but I've mostly moved over to latex for most of my assignments now. I still use my iphone x which was one of the last iphones to still have force touch, which was imo a really underrated feature that I wouldn't want to give up. and ofc, I got all my apple gadgets in matching space gray.

I have a really nice pair of ANC headphones that I use all the time as well as a pair of Anker bluetooth earbuds that I occasionally use on the go. I use a wireless charger for my phone as well as a usb-c hub with pass through charging for connecting to my monitors and chargin everything at the same time.

### Apps

I use chrome for browsing the web, vscode as my main editor, and iterm2 as my preferred terminal emulator. I use the pocket extension on chrome and my phone to save any interesting articles to read through later, and feedly for keeping up the RSS feeds of blogs that I like to follow. I mostly use discord to keep in touch with friends, figma to mockup designs and make memes, and I have the procreate app, even though I've almost never used it.

### Vscode

I use vscode with the following plugins that I find helpful:

- [Github dark theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)
- [Discord presence](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=icrawl.discord-vscode)
- [Latex Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)
- [Prettier code formatting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Pylance python language server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer)
- [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync)

### Dev

I use nightly Rust, the latest version of Node through nvm, Python 3.9 through miniconda, and Latex through MacTex and homebrew. I also recently set up a nice vim [configuration](https://github.com/bkkaggle/dotfiles) with almost all the features that I would have had through vscode, which is nice when I just want to edit something in the terminal or when I'm working on a remote machine through ssh. I use CoC for autocompletion with the following language server plugins: `coc-tsserver coc-json coc-html coc-css coc-clangd coc-rust-analyzer coc-latex coc-python`.

### Misc

I've remaped my caps-lock key to `esc` since my mac doesn't have a physical escape key which is still in a pretty awkward place to reach. I use the JetBrains mono font so I can make use of ligatures when coding, and I've [configured](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/259093/can-touch-id-for-the-mac-touch-bar-authenticate-sudo-users-and-admin-privileges/306324#306324) my terminal to let me authenticate commands like `sudo` with touchid. I use a 4k version of the firewatch wallpaper on all my devices.
