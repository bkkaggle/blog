<p>i applied to university like every other canadian kid born in 2002 around september of last year, filled out my OUAC application, spent a lot longer than i should have looking over my AIF, and finally finished the main part of all my university applications by early january, JIT for covid 🥲.</p>

<p>thankfully covid didn’t have as much of an effect on my application (at least compared to everyone applying this fall). i remember that the CCC went on pretty much like normal and that the Euclid math contest was effectively cancelled, and i was able to finish off the rest of my courses by mid april. this meant that I got to have a 4.5-ish month summer vacation before starting university in the fall, which was the longest amount of free time that i’m probably going to have for a pretty long time, and while having all this free time was pretty fun at the beginning, eventually i got bored and started counting down the days to when school would start. I got my decision letters in early may (accepted to software engineering, rejected from CS), and enrolled into the software engineering program.</p>

<p>By early june-ish (i think), it was pretty obvious that covid really wasn’t going to go away any time soon and that our 1A term would be online (1B is also online), which meant that there was no way i was going to move to waterloo in the middle of a pandemic (covid miller hall 👀).</p>

<h1 id="meeting-the-cohort">
<a class="anchor" href="#meeting-the-cohort" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>meeting the cohort</h1>

<p>ok, so my whole experience over the last 4 months isn’t <em>all</em> doom-and-gloom, i honestly had a lot of really amazing times with my cohort which gave us a chance to get to know each other and feel a lot less isolated. in early may, i stumbled onto a discord server for software engineering 2025 students, which even in those early days was pretty active had a really nice vibe to it which is still there 8 months later. The biggest highlight of the software engineering program and the last 8-ish months in general was definitely the cohort system that gives you several dozen friends right as you start university (or in our case, 4 months before it even started).</p>

<p>through that server, i got to get to know a lot of really nice, funny, and all-around awesome people (you know who you are!). i’m not too sure about this since i don’t know a lot of people in my year who are in other programs, but our cohort really has developed this sense of community that i think really helped with the isolation of studying alone [INSERT CAPTION]. there’s this whole stereotype of waterloo students—especially those in cs and engineering—that i really haven’t felt like i experienced while in SE, but ymmv.</p>

<p>just to list a few of the things that my cohort did before school even started: there was a phase where we made a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#social-media</code> channel that ended up with everyone posting their github profiles, a couple of students organized a mini hackathon in june, we also hosted weekly game nights and video calls, as well as a movie night once (the frequency of these events dropped pretty quickly once school started), and i remember that there was this SE party that a bunch of people hosted during orientation week.</p>

<p>we also had a sticker+hoodie competition in june to design a software engineering class of ‘25 sweater and had the hoodies shipped out by september, through <a href="https://softwears.ca/">softwears</a>. idk about you, but imo our designs are pretty slick: [IMAGES].</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>just to throw some shade on the cs first years, i saw a post on their discord in mid october saying that they still haven’t been able to choose a hoodie design 🥲</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the time school started in early september, i’m pretty sure only about 20-30 people in the cohort chose to move to waterloo, while the rest studied from home (same story for the winter tem). most of us are in the toronto/GTA area or elsewhere in ontario, but there are also groups of people studying from elsewhere in canada, quite a few international students studying across <em>many</em> timezones, as well as a few who took a gap year or entered university a few years early.</p>

<h1 id="1a">
<a class="anchor" href="#1a" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1A</h1>

<p>when september 8 finally rolled around i’m pretty sure that many people (including me) were looking forward to school starting if only to have <em>something</em> change. the first day of two of classes were <em>interesting</em> to say the least. since all our classes were online and asynchronous, with office hours twice a week replacing live lectures, we really didn’t have much of a “schedule” that we could follow other than knowing when assignments are due. a lot of credit to making sure that we didn’t forget when assignments are due goes to the people who set up notion calendars and google docs with all the information scattered across all the different platforms that we had to use. going to the office hours in the first few days of class was a pretty unforgettable experience, from the non-stop pings from webex whenever someone joined the call to the chat section of every call looking like twitch.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>rant time:
it’s absolutely incredible how almost every prof and course uses a totally different set of online platforms for textbooks/course notes/assignments/quizzes/exams. Just to list out the ones that come to mind, we had learn, crowdmark, sapling, marmoset, the UW mobius, and the Nelson mobius, and many of these platforms were buggy, slow, and most importantly, $$$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the courseload was also a really difficult thing for a lot of people to get to used to. we had 5 full courses and se101 which was a “quarter-credit” course that was a bunch of short weekly activities and a term-long group project. i’ve heard that in a <em>normal year</em>, we usually have an assignment or quiz due for each course every week, along with midterms and finals. in contrast, we had two (time consuming) assignments due every week for each course, as well as midterms and finals for two courses and 3 monthly “term tests” for the other two. the university decided to put more emphasis on assignments and quizzes while making exams shorter, unproctored, and open-book, in an effort to make cheating less of a concern. one pretty negative outcome of this was that we had to work on assignments for our other courses during our term test and midterm weeks. otoh, most of our exams were pretty low-stess.</p>

<p>i looked up the class profile for the software engineering class of 2020 and their attendance rate decreased over time from the low 90s in 1A to about 50% by 4B. i personally stopped going to pretty much any synchronous office hour or tutorial after the first one or two weeks of class since it really wasn’t worth spending the time there when i could be working on an assignment instead—i know that a pretty large portion of the class skipped most of their classes, so our attendance graph is going to look <em>very</em> weird when we make our class profile in a few years.</p>

<h2 id="math-115">
<a class="anchor" href="#math-115" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>math 115</h2>

<p>math 115 was our linear algebra course, and was for many of us, our favorite and most well-delivered course (big props to the profs for co-ordinating the course really well). the assignments were pretty well made and challenging while not being impossible or ambigously worded, and the course notes were <em>very</em> well made—latex notes for each chapter that were good enough that you could self-study everything you needed from them. also, our prof for this course was really good even though this was his first time teaching at uw (and he’d usually bring his cat to office hours).</p>

<h2 id="math-135">
<a class="anchor" href="#math-135" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>math 135</h2>

<p>math 135 was our mathematical proofs course where you finish the course by using everything you have learned so far to implement and prove the RSA encryption algorithm. the course notes for this course were also very well made just like math 115. 135 was definitely the toughest course we had this term when it came to the material and assignments being pretty challenging. our cohort was split across a couple of different sections of this course so we all had different profs (my section’s prof played music in the background during office hours, which was a definite plus). overall i kinda enjoyed this course in a way.</p>

<h2 id="math-117">
<a class="anchor" href="#math-117" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>math 117</h2>

<p>math 117 was our calculus 1 course and on paper should have been easy for anyone who took AP or IB calculus in high school, but the assignments were tough enough to make sure that you really understood the material. again, the course notes for this course were pretty good and it was an ok course, it would have been nice if you could get them as a pdf, but w/e. right after the midterm, a lot of people stayed up until 12am to wait for the 24 hour exam period to end and to see their marks on the mcq part of the exam, which weren’t actually released until a few days later. this lead to a sort of funny situation where someone started a chant of “when grade” in a channel, which eventually got reposted to piazza and lead to a pretty hilarious response from the instructors.</p>

<h2 id="cs-137">
<a class="anchor" href="#cs-137" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>cs 137</h2>

<p>cs 137 was our intro to CS course. it was probably the easiest course of the term for a lot of people since we only had one assignment and quiz due every week and no midterm. the quizzes and assignments were pretty easy in comparison to our other math courses (some people speedran through their quizzes in under a minute)  the course notes for this course on the other hand, were unfortunately really terrible—looking like they were hastily put together in ms word with very little thought, bad formatting, multiple errors, sometimes blurry screenshots of code examples with messily drawn arrows in what looked like ms paint, and bad explanations. you expect a <em>university-level</em> cs course, especially one at a university that is mostly known for its cs department, to be of a <em>certain minimum</em> quality and to at least have <em>some</em> amount of effort into making the course notes <em>presentable</em>, but cs137 unfortunately did not meet that level in my opinion.</p>

<h2 id="se-101">
<a class="anchor" href="#se-101" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>se 101</h2>

<p>se 101 is a quarter credit course that is supposed to teach you the more practical aspects of software development. we started off with this cool spaceship group project where you learn how to use git through powerpuff girl memes and have the SE program director’s children crash the teams call to talk about minecraft. then, you work with 16 other people to work on controlling different parts of a spaceship inside the Godot (imagine my surprise that it’s pronouced go-doh and not go-dot) game engine. the whole project was pretty buggy since godot didn’t play well with a lot of people’s computers but it was a fun way to get to some of the people in the cohort. the remainder of the course was a series of short weekly activities that you work on with a rotating group of people, and a term long project where you build something in a group of 5.</p>

<p>i was very lucky to be able to team up with 3 other awesome team members and we were able to pretty successfully make a project remotely and without most of our team having access to the hardware while balancing all of our other courses. [video]. I had a lot of fun filming [this] part of our demo video, even if i ended up cutting it from the final cut of the video.</p>

<h2 id="ece-105">
<a class="anchor" href="#ece-105" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ece 105</h2>

<p>ah now to our final course: ece 105 classical mechanics. so this course has a sort of reputation of being the one course that everyone in the se or ece programs dreads, and imo it is very well deserved because a <em>lot</em> of things went wrong with this course.</p>

<p>we had weekly assignments that all together counted for 20% of our final on the nelson mobius which originally were pretty buggy since the formatting of the questions as well as how you had to enter in your answers was pretty finnicky. to fix this, prof mansour turned on the “how did i do” feature (for what i assume was temporarily while the bugs were ironed out) for almost every question on every assignment, telling you in real time whether or not your answer was correct as well as a fully worked out solution and final answer. Essentially, we got 20% of our course’s final grade for free. Also the questions on all our weekly quizzes were pretty ambigously worded and felt rushed—there was one time where i counted 6 pretty badly misspelled words in a single 2-3 line question (“fricitonal”, “backwrards”, “courterclockwiese”). on top of this, we were originally randomly given different versions of the quizzes which were of <em>very</em> different difficulties (the avg for one was 80% vs 30% for the other). [EXAM WEIGHTING] on a lighter note, the whole first year experience wouldn’t be complete without listening to mansour’s stories, the “war story firecrackers” one is hard to beat.</p>

<h1 id="blobheart">
<a class="anchor" href="#blobheart" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>:blobheart:</h1>

<p>outside of studying, i’ve managed to have a good time with my cohort. here’s a short-ish list of things that i remember that we did:</p>

<ul>
  <li>somewhat daily cat pics in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#cute-animals</code> (now <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#tasty-animals</code>)</li>
  <li>a lot of people, me included, taking discord’s halloween themed trick’cord treat bot way <em>too</em> seriously and competitively enough that there would be times where the server would be very quiet for a long time at 12am and a bot would drop a new treat and you’d see four or five people all type out h!trick and send it out in under a second.</li>
  <li>continuing from ^, we were so obsessed with it a lot of people (you know who you are) were still playing during our 24 hour exam periods instead of studying.</li>
  <li>making a bot that lists out our piles of upcoming assignments and responding with “that’s rough, buddy”</li>
  <li>late night chats at 2am while working on assignments that are due in the morning</li>
  <li>talking in french because ???</li>
  <li>birthday countdowns</li>
  <li>updating discord statuses every day</li>
  <li>live discussion of <em>that</em> debate and countless messages of “oh he’s only X votes behind now”</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#quotes</code> with a lot of material that is not fit to be published here</li>
</ul>
